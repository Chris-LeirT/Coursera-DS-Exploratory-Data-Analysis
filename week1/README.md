# Coursera Data science week 1 assignment  

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]
* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:  

1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy  
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss  
3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)  
4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)  
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)  
6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)  
7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).  
8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.  
9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.  

The four plots that need to be constructed are shown below:
